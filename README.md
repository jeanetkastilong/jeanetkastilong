About me:

I am a 5th semester student with a main focus in the field of Big Data. I have developed an understanding of the core concepts of Big Data, including data collection, processing, analysis, and visualization at scale. Throughout my studies, I have been involved in various projects that involve the use of the latest technologies and tools in Big Data analysis, such as SAS Viya, Tableau, Power BI, Ms. Excel, and programming languages like Python.
